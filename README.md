# note-to-test

Generating tests from Clojure notes

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.scicloj/note-to-test.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/note-to-test)

## Status
Initial draft

## Intro

This is a tiny library for testable-documentation / literate-testing in Clojure.

It can automatically generate tests:
- from code examples in namespaces - already supported
- from code examples in docstrings - coming soon

Tests are created by running code examples and remembering their outputs. The person writing the documentation is responsible for checking that these outputs are sensible. The tests are responsible for checking these outputs remain the same on future versions.

Tests are accumulated in standard clojure.test files. Each namespace of code examples has its own generated test file.

Old tests are kept until one removes them manually (or explicitly asks to clean them up). New tests are added if they are based on code examples which do not appear in the test files yet.

## Usage

```clj
(require '[scicloj.note-to-test.v1.api :as note-to-test])
```

Assume you have a namespace, say `dum.dummy` in the file [notebooks/dum/dummy.clj](notebooks/dum/dummy.clj), which has some code examples in it.

```clj
(note-to-test/run! "notebooks/dum/dummy.clj")
```
would generate a test namespace 'dum.dummy-generated-test' in the file [test/dum/dummy_generated_test.clj](test/dum/dummy_generated_test.clj) with clojure.test tests verifying that those code examples actually return the values they had at the time we executed that `run!` call.

If that namespace already exists, then we keep the existing tests (verifying old values that have been generated in the past). We avoid adding new tests for the code examples that already appear in existing tests.

```clj
(note-to-test/run! "notebooks/dum/dummy.clj"
                   {:cleanup-existing-tests? true})
```
would first clean the test namespace up, removing all existing tests.

## TODO
- document the extensible support for special values (beyond plain clj data)

## Wishlist
- support an alternative plain-data output format to help seeing the output changes explicitly
- make clear error messages:
  - when outputs change
  - when the code fails
- support code examples in comment blocks?
- support metadata to skip certain forms
- remove nil outputs?
- support docstrings
  - generate tests from code examples in docstrings
  - explore generate docstrings in a structured way (marking code examples explicitly)
