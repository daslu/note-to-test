# note-to-test

Generating tests from Clojure notes

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.scicloj/note-to-test.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/note-to-test)

## Status
Initial draft

## Intro
coming soon

## Intro draft
3 sources of truth about our library's intended behavior:
- docstrings - make them in a structured way
- tutorials - ns-as-a-notebook
- unit tests - partially generated from the above
 
## Usage

```clj
(require '[scicloj.note-to-test.v1.api :as note-to-test])
```

Assume you have a namespace, say `dum.dummy` in the file [notebooks/dum/dummy.clj](notebooks/dum/dummy.clj), which has some code examples in it.

```clj
(note-to-test/run! "notebooks/dum/dummy.clj")
```
would generate a test namespace 'dum.dummy-generated-test' in the file [test/dum/dummy_generated_test.clj](test/dum/dummy-generated-test.clj) with clojure.test tests verifying that those code examples actually return the values they had at the time we executed that `run!` call.

If that namespace already exists, then we keep the existing tests (verifying old values that have been generated in the past). We avoid adding new tests for the code examples that already appear in existing tests.

```clj
(note-to-test/run! "notebooks/dum/dummy.clj"
                   {:cleanup-existing-tests? true})
```
would first clean the test namespace up, removing all existing tests.

## TODO
- name this library
- document the extensible support for special values (beyind plain clj data)

## Wishlist
- support an alternative plain-data output format to help seeing the output changes explicitly
- make clear error messages:
  - when outputs change
  - when the code fails
- support code examples in comment blocks?
- support metadata to skip certain forms
- remove nil outputs?
- support docstrings
  - generate tests from code examples in docstrings
  - explore generate docstrings in a structured way (marking code examples explicitly)
